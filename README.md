# Grand-Strategy-Game

This is a strategy game that I am writing - mostly as a learning tool. I was heavily inspired by the game __Polytopia__, (which you should totally check out).

## Goals
all my plans are currently laid out in the plan.md file.

## Dependencies
  - SFML - for graphics, networking, etc.
  - libnoise - for generating random maps

## Installation
```
cd <installation dir>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Build should be fairly quick. I have only tested this on my desktop running Linux, however it *should* be cross platform, no guaruntees.
