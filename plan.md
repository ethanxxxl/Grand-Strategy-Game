This game will not be a 4x game, in the sense that the winner is decided by who
has the most technology. Instead, games should be won by combat strategy.

#World
The world will be randomly generated, and split into either a square or
hexagonal lattice - I haven't decided yet.

Each tile will have resources that will be exploited by the population.


#GDP
The player is a ruler of a capitalistic nation. They do not need to worry about
increasing their GDP each turn. That will happen automatically.

#Military
The size of the players military is affected by the population. The
population should stay fairly constant throughout the game, as I don't think wars don't
typically last long enough for populations to significantly increase. To
increase the head count of the military,

##Army
Army structure will be based off of the US army. The player will be able to
divide the army into Divisions, Brigades, Battalions, and Companies.

The player can allot create and allot soldiers to companies. However,
Companies must contain at least 150 soldiers.

Each company will have combat stats, that determine how well it performs in
battle. These stats will include:

  - Proficiency
  - Readiness
  - Technology
  - Moral

All of those values will be multiplied together to form that companies _Combat
Effectiveness (CE)_. The combat effectiveness of a company helps determine the
outcome of combat on a specific tile.

#Combat
if a player decides that they want to attack a tile, they will have to move the
companies onto a tile that is within their range.
